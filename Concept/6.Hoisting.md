## Hoisting

- Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the
top of their scope before code execution. 
- Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not
initialisation.
- JavaScript moves declarations (not initializations) to the top of their scope during compilation.

- var variables are hoisted and initialized as undefined.

- let and const are hoisted but not initialized â†’ accessing them before declaration throws ReferenceError.

```
var favoriteFood = "grapes";

var foodThoughts = function () {
    console.log("Original favorite food: " + favoriteFood); // undefined
    var favoriteFood = "sushi";
    console.log("New favorite food: " + favoriteFood); // sushi
};

foodThoughts();

```
Function declarations are also hoisted:
Avoid using var to reduce hoisting confusion. Prefer let and const.


```

a(); // Outputs: "bye"


function a() {
    console.log("hi");
}

function a() {
    console.log("bye");
}

```
