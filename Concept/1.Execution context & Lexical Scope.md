## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution Context

- JavaScript is a single-threaded interpreted language.
- Every browser has its own JavaScript engine (e.g., V8 in Google Chrome).
- When the JavaScript engine scans a script file, it creates an **Execution Context** that manages how the code is executed.

### Types of Execution Context:
- **Global Execution Context:** Created when a script starts (once).
- **Function Execution Context:** Created every time a function is invoked.

### Phases of Execution Context:
1. **Creation Phase**
   - Creates global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js).
   - Allocates memory for variables and functions.
   - Variables initialized to `undefined`.

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Executes the code line-by-line.
   - Assigns values to variables and invokes functions.

3. **Destruction Phase**
   - Memory is cleaned up after function execution.

## üåê Lexical Environment

- Lexical Environment = Local memory + Reference to parent environment.
- Determined by **where a function is defined**, not called.
- JavaScript uses **Lexical Scope**, not dynamic scope.
- The first Lexical Environment is the global environment.

```js
function printName() {
    return "Shital Padole";
}

function WriteName() {
    function a() {
        // inner lexical scope
    }
    return printName();
}

function sayName() {
    return WriteName();
}

sayName();
```
